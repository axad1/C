## Storage
It creates a folder in the current directory named as **data**.
<br/>
It uses simple text files with the username to store the contacts.

## Requirement
It needs a Linux Environment to work perfectly.

## Files
- phonebook.c
<br/>
It contains Login and Register implementation and it is the main file to compile.
- helper.c
<br/>
All other functions are implemented in this file to manipulate contacts.
<br/>
- user.dat
It is data file where registed users are stored.
<br/>
- /data folder
<br/>
Contact list files are stored in this folder with name username.txt where username is the user's name which is currently login.

## How to Execute
To execute the program compile **phonebook.c** file with a C compiler and create an executable.
<br/>
Run the executable file.

## Thoughts
As it was not easy in C language to implement this simple program as compare to other programming languages.
But it gives me a very good knowledge of C.
