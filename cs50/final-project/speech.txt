Hi I am Asad.

This is my final project for cs50 called Phonebook.

It is a command-line-program to store contacts.

There are three options - Login, Register, Exit.

When you try to login it checks for users - if there are no user registered - it shows the message that no user is registered.

Now we try to register a user.

It asks for the username and password.

If there is any empty field - it will show the error message - invalid input.

If the username already exists it will show the error message - user already exist.

If the user is registered successfully it shows the success message.

Now we try to login - It asks for the username and password.

If the login is successfull - It shows the menu of various options like add new contact, display all contacts, search by name, search by number, delete contact, delete all contacts and logout.

Now I want to display all contacts - it shows that the list is empty.

So i will add a new contact.

It asks for the contact name and number.

If there is any empty field - it will show the error message - invalid input.

Again try to add new contact - it shows success message.

I can see my all contacts now.

I can search the contact by name.

It asks for the contact name to search.

If the name exist it will show the contact details.

I can search the contact by it's number.

It asks for the contact number to search.

If the number exist it will show the contact details.

I can delete a contact.

It asks for the contact name to delete.

If the contact exist it will delete it.

I can delete all contacts.

It will prompt the user for yes or no - on yes it will clear the file - and on no it will return to the menu.

Now i can logout to return to the main menu.

I've tried my best to implement various validation rules.

This is cs50.
